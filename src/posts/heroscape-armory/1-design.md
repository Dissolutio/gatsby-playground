## Crafting a User-Interface

If you didn't know, create-react-app v2 came out recently. So all the cool kids are making web apps and UI right now.

Let's build one too! [Snag my code if you want to code along!](https://github.com/Dissolutio/heroscape-armory.git) If you want to do the starter, just delete the `src` directory and rename the `src.starter-files` to `src`.

### The mission

There is a boardgame, called Heroscape, that is a turn based strategy board game. Each player assembles an army of figurines, and each of these figurines has a card associated with it.

This card has all the stats for the unit, and searching through all the cards can be a pain, especially if they have been lost or damaged.

Our app will present the cards of Heroscape, and allow a user to choose which ones they want in their army. Very simple, but adventure awaits for the novice developer!

### The method

The React documentation is marvelous, and has a section called [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html), where they break down how to approach
designing your UI.

1. [Start with a mock](#step1)

2. [Break the UI into a component hierarchy](#step2)

3. [Build a Static Version in React](#step3)

4. [Identify the Minimal (but complete) Representation of UI State](#step4)

5. [Identify where your state should live](#step5)

6. Add inverse data flow

<h2 id="step1">Start with a mock</h2>

Up top, we have a search bar, a point readout, and the army cards the user has chosen.
Down below, the gallery of cards for browsing.

I only imagine people using this app on their phones, so that is definitely what I'm gearing for.

When they want to view a card, I want a modal so they can see all the data.

**Our data** will be an array of objects. Each object will look like this:

<details>
<summary>Our card/unit object</summary>

```js
{
  name: 'Frost Giant of Morh',
  image: 'frostgiantofmorh.jpg',
  general: 'utgar',
  race: 'giant',
  type: 'uncommon hero',
  className: 'brute',
  personality: 'fearless',
  height: 'huge 9',
  life: '6',
  move: '5',
  range: '1',
  attack: '4',
  defense: '4',
  points: '140',
  figures: '1',
  hexes: '1',
  setWave: "Expansion Set",
  abilities: [
    {
      name: '1st',
      desc: '1st',
    },
    {
      name: '2nd etc.',
      desc: '2nd etc.',
    },
  ],
}
```

</details>

<h2 id="step2">Break the UI into a component hierarchy</h2>

My app has two sections, the Army stuff up top, and the Gallery down below. There will be a modal, but I will put that as part of the Gallery:

1. Army area:

   - Army List
   - Army List Item
   - Point Readout
   - Search Input

2. Gallery area:

   - Gallery List
   - Gallery List Item
   - Modal
   - Detailed Card (for Modal)

<h2 id="step3">Build a static version in React</h2>

The react docs sum it up well:

<blockquote>
The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. Itâ€™s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.
</blockquote>

So it's time to build now, just a real simple skeleton with no State...

Now, I'm not sure if it's standard, but I like the directory structure of my project to make it obvious how the program flows. For a really big project I'm sure this might go out the window. I'm also going to go ahead and make test files next to each component, though I will only start them with the same simple test Create-React-App gives me for free (I'm really new to testing):

```js
// EveryComponent.test.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div')
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div)
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div)
})
```

And it isn't pretty, but here is everything rendering in the browser (Hooray!):

<h2 id="step4">Identify the Minimal (but complete) Representation of UI State</h2>

Our App State will include:

- All the Heroscape Cards (the Library, could be expanded and editable in future versions)
- A search input value
- The filtered Heroscape Cards to display

- Army (the cards in the army , the maximum point value allowed)
- Modal (on/off , which card to show )

<h2 id="step5">Identify Where Your State Should Live</h2>

I will be accessing army and gallery related State from both the Army and Gallery component trees. So I reckon we better make a State Container above both of these components, so they can share without fuss. This will keep our code the cleanest, and make it easier to extend it later.
