    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is John, I am mostly curious and thankful.</p>
    <p>
      In January 2018 is when I decided I was going to learn how to code and get
      a developer job or build a freelance business. It's been a lot of work
      since then, but work with passion behind it can really make the time fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main tools lately are Node.js and React.js, but the modern toolset is
      rapidly expanding, and I am thrilled to perpetually learn new techniques
      and architechtures. The wild world of software is a playground for my
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The challenges facing humanity, and the individual human, are great. There
      are helpers around the world who are drawn to a bigger picture of the
      future, a positive vision. They are all around, and they are doing
      valuable, urgent work on many fronts to construct a sustainable and
      equitable global human civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these helpers, with all their renewable energy, ecological
      restoration, social work, holistic health and organizational transparency
      , need powerful web solutions and are often short on funds to compete for
      cutting edge tech. Gee, who's gonna build those?
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a lot of work to do, and it makes my life so easy lucky and free
      to know my place in the struggle.
    </p>
